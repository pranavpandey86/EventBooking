                               (Cosmos DB)
```

## 🚀 **Next Implementation Options - Choose Your Path:**

### **Option A: Build All Backend Services (Recommended)**
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Learning Focus**: Complete microservices architecture

```bash
Sprint 1: TicketInventory Service (Cosmos DB + Concurrency)
Sprint 2: PaymentProcessing Service (Saga Pattern + Security)  
Sprint 3: NotificationService (Multi-channel + Templates)
Sprint 4: API Gateway (Routing + Authentication)
```

### **Option B: Build One Service at a Time with Testing**
**Timeline**: 1 week per service
**Learning Focus**: Deep dive into each pattern

```bash
Week 1: TicketInventory + Integration Tests
Week 2: PaymentProcessing + Security Implementation
Week 3: NotificationService + Performance Testing
Week 4: API Gateway + End-to-End Testing
```

### **Option C: Build Frontend First (User-Centric)**
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Learning Focus**: Frontend-backend integration

```bash
Week 1: Angular app with EventManagement integration
Week 2: Add remaining services as we build them
```

### **Option D: Infrastructure-First Approach**
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Learning Focus**: DevOps and cloud deployment

```bash
Week 1: Complete Azure setup + CI/CD pipelines
Then: Deploy services as we build them
```

## 📋 **Best Practices We'll Implement**

### **Microservices Patterns:**
- ✅ **Database-per-service** (SQL + Cosmos DB mix)
- ✅ **Event-driven communication** (Service Bus)
- ✅ **Saga pattern** for distributed transactions
- ✅ **CQRS** for read/write optimization
- ✅ **Circuit breaker** for resilience
- ✅ **API versioning** for evolution

### **Cloud-Native Features:**
- ✅ **Container orchestration** (Kubernetes/AKS)
- ✅ **Service mesh** (Istio for traffic management)
- ✅ **Observability** (Application Insights)
- ✅ **Security** (Azure AD B2C, Key Vault)
- ✅ **Scalability** (Auto-scaling, load balancing)

### **Development Practices:**
- ✅ **Clean Architecture** in each service
- ✅ **Domain-Driven Design** (DDD)
- ✅ **Test-Driven Development** (TDD)
- ✅ **Continuous Integration/Deployment**
- ✅ **Infrastructure as Code**

## 💰 **Azure Free Tier Strategy (Your Learning Focus)**

### **Free Tier Services We'll Use:**
- ✅ **Azure App Service** (10 web apps) - Host all 5 APIs
- ✅ **Azure SQL Database** (250GB) - EventManagement + PaymentProcessing  
- ✅ **Azure Cosmos DB** (1000 RU/s) - TicketInventory + NotificationService
- ✅ **Azure Service Bus** (750 hours) - Event-driven messaging
- ✅ **Azure Functions** (1M executions) - Lightweight processing
- ✅ **Azure Storage** (5GB) - File uploads, templates
- ✅ **Application Insights** (5GB logs) - Monitoring

### **Cost Breakdown:**
- **Phase 1**: 100% Free (All core learning)
- **Phase 2**: $5-20/month (Enhanced features)
- **Phase 3**: $50-150/month (Production-like)

## 🤔 **What Should We Build Next?**

**My Recommendation**: **TicketInventory Service**

**Why?**
- Shows **real-time concurrency handling**
- Demonstrates **Cosmos DB NoSQL patterns**
- Teaches **optimistic locking** and **race condition handling**
- **Event-driven integration** with other services
- **Most challenging technical problems** (great for learning)

**Would take 2-3 days to build with:**
- Cosmos DB setup and modeling
- High-concurrency ticket reservation logic
- Service Bus integration for inventory updates
- Real-time availability APIs

## 🎯 **Your Decision - What's Next?**

1. **🚀 Build TicketInventory Service** (my recommendation)
2. **🏗️ Complete Azure infrastructure setup first**  
3. **🎨 Start the Angular frontend**
4. **🔧 Add advanced features to EventManagement**

**Which path excites you most for learning microservices and cloud-native development?**

The goal is to give you **hands-on experience** with all the patterns and practices used in **real production systems**!
