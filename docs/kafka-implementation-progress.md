# Kafka Implementation Progress

## Phase 5A: Local Kafka Setup ✅ COMPLETED

### What we accomplished:
1. **Kafka Infrastructure Setup**
   - Added Zookeeper service (coordination) on port 2181
   - Added Kafka broker service on port 9092
   - Added Kafka UI for monitoring on port 8090
   - Configured proper health checks and dependencies
   - Added persistent volumes for data retention

2. **Docker Compose Integration**
   - Successfully integrated Kafka services into existing docker-compose.yml
   - Fixed file corruption issues with duplicate service definitions
   - Validated YAML syntax and configuration
   - All services starting successfully with health checks passing

3. **Topic Creation**
   - Created core event topics:
     - `event-created` (6 partitions)
     - `event-updated` (6 partitions)  
     - `event-deleted` (6 partitions)
   - Configured for single-node setup with replication factor 1
   - Ready for event-driven architecture implementation

### Current Status:
- ✅ Zookeeper: Running and healthy
- ✅ Kafka Broker: Running and healthy  
- ✅ Kafka UI: Accessible at http://localhost:8090
- ✅ Event Topics: Created and ready for use
- ✅ Docker Compose: Validated and working

## Phase 5B: Service Integration (NEXT)

### Immediate Next Steps:

1. **EventManagement Service - Producer Setup**
   - Add Kafka NuGet packages (Confluent.Kafka)
   - Create event publishing service
   - Integrate with existing event CRUD operations
   - Define event schemas/contracts

2. **EventSearch Service - Consumer Setup**
   - Add Kafka consumer for event processing
   - Replace HTTP calls with event consumption
   - Maintain existing Elasticsearch indexing logic
   - Add consumer health checks

3. **Event Schema Design**
   - Define JSON schemas for event payloads
   - Ensure backward compatibility
   - Add validation and error handling

### Architecture Evolution:

**Before (HTTP-based):**
```
EventManagement API → HTTP POST → EventSearch API → Elasticsearch
```

**After (Event-driven):**
```
EventManagement API → Kafka Topic → EventSearch Consumer → Elasticsearch
```

### Benefits of This Approach:
- **Decoupling**: Services don't need direct communication
- **Resilience**: Messages are persisted and retryable
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more consumers
- **Monitoring**: Rich observability through Kafka UI
- **Future-proof**: Foundation for additional services

## Configuration Details:

### Kafka Broker Configuration:
- **Bootstrap Server**: localhost:9092 (external), kafka:29092 (internal)
- **Partitions**: 6 per topic (horizontal scaling ready)
- **Replication Factor**: 1 (single-node setup)
- **Auto Topic Creation**: Enabled
- **Log Retention**: 7 days (168 hours)

### Network Configuration:
- **Network**: ticketing-network (bridge)
- **Service Discovery**: Internal DNS resolution
- **Health Checks**: Kafka broker API validation

### Volume Persistence:
- **Kafka Data**: Persistent storage for message logs
- **Zookeeper Data**: Cluster metadata persistence
- **Zookeeper Logs**: Transaction log persistence

## Next Development Session Plan:

1. **Update EventManagement Service**
   - Install Kafka client packages
   - Create IEventPublisher interface
   - Implement KafkaEventPublisher
   - Update controllers to publish events

2. **Update EventSearch Service**  
   - Install Kafka client packages
   - Create background service for consuming events
   - Replace HTTP synchronization with event processing
   - Test end-to-end event flow

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Test event publishing from EventManagement
   - Verify event consumption in EventSearch
   - Validate Elasticsearch indexing still works
   - Performance testing with event volumes

## Phase 5C: Kubernetes Integration (FUTURE)

- Create Kafka StatefulSets for K8s deployment
- Configure persistent volumes for production
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Scale testing with multiple replicas

**Status**: Kafka infrastructure ready ✅  
**Next**: Service integration for event-driven architecture  
**Goal**: Replace HTTP calls with async event messaging
